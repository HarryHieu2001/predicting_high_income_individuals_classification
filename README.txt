This dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, is based on the 1994 U.S. Census.

Its goal is to classify adults into two income groups:

<=50K USD per year

>50K USD per year

By analyzing factors such as education, gender, race, and occupation, the study aims to understand how these variables influence income levels in the 1990s.These insights also help reveal social and economic patterns

🚀 This is my very first Data Analysis & Machine Learning project!

I’m so excited to share my final project — “Predicting High-Income Individuals”, where I built a classification model to predict whether a person earns more than $50K per year using the UCI Adult Income dataset.

📊 Project Overview
The dataset comes from the 1994 U.S. Census and includes demographic and employment-related features such as age, education, occupation, working hours, and gender.
The goal is to classify individuals into two income groups:
≤50K USD
>50K USD
By analyzing these factors, I aimed to explore which attributes most influence income levels and how they reflect broader social and economic patterns.

🧠 Key Steps
Data cleaning & preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python & visualization
Dealing with imbalanced data using SMOTE
Training and comparing 4 models:
Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

🏆 Result Highlights
The Gradient Boosting model achieved the best overall performance:
✅ Accuracy: 0.81
✅ ROC-AUC: 0.887
✅ Balanced precision and recall
💡 Top income-related factors: education level, age, and working hours per week.

🔍 Key Insights
Individuals earning >50K tend to be older, more educated, work longer hours, and often hold professional or managerial positions.
Those earning ≤50K are younger, often work fewer hours, and mostly employed in private sectors or service jobs.
